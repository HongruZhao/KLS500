# Brownian motion construction

A 1-dimensional Brownian motion is a process `W : ℝ → Ω → ℝ` (interpreted on
`t ≥ 0`) with the standard Wiener properties (zero start, Gaussian
independent increments, continuous paths).

`BrownianMotion` and its basic properties are developed here from Mathlib
alone; existence of a witness is proved separately in `Brownian/Existence.lean`,
via the `RemyDegenne/brownian-motion` dependency's canonical Brownian motion.

  real `s` and lets `(W_s)_{s ≥ 0}` be viewed as an `ℝ`-indexed process. -/

  /-- **σ-algebra-level joint independence of past and future increment.** For
  `0 ≤ s < t`, the σ-algebra `⨆ u ≤ s, σ(W_u)` (which is the natural filtration
  at time `s`) is independent of `σ(W_t − W_s)`. This is strictly stronger than
  the derived pairwise statement `BrownianMotion.increment_independent` and is
  needed to apply `MeasureTheory.condExp_indep_eq` to derive the
  conditional-expectation identities `𝔼[W_t − W_s | ℱ_s] = 0` and
  `𝔼[(W_t − W_s)² | ℱ_s] = t − s`.
  For Brownian motion this follows from joint Gaussianity; we package it as
  a structural hypothesis since the eventual `BrownianMotion.exists` will
  provide it directly via `iIndepFun_pi` on the increment family. -/
