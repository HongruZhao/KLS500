# Poisson random measure on `[0, ∞) × E`

A *Poisson random measure* on the time-space `[0, ∞) × E` (where `E` is a
measurable mark space with σ-finite intensity `ν`), defined over a
probability space `(Ω, P)`, is a measurable family

  `N : Ω → Measure (ℝ × E)`

with the following properties:

* For each measurable `B ⊆ ℝ × E` with `(volume.restrict [0,∞) ⊗ ν)(B) < ∞`,
  `N(·, B) ~ Poisson` with mean equal to that intensity.
* For any pairwise-disjoint family of such sets, the random variables
  `(N(·, B_i))_i` are independent under `P`.

This is the time-aware structure required for the *compensated* integral
`∫_0^t ∫_E φ(s, e) Ñ(ds, de)` to be well-defined.

## Construction

The intensity is `volume.restrict (Set.Ici 0) ⊗ ν` (Lebesgue restricted to `[0, ∞)` tensor `ν`
on the mark space). `PoissonRandomMeasure.exists_of_sigmaFinite` builds a Poisson random
measure by the Poisson recipe: the time-space is cut into the cells `[n, n+1) × sₘ` of a
σ-finite decomposition, each cell of positive intensity carries a Poisson number of
independent marks distributed according to the normalised intensity, and the cells are
superposed (`LevyStochCalc.Poisson.superposition`).

/-- A *Poisson random measure on `[0, ∞) × E`* with intensity
`volume.restrict [0,∞) ⊗ ν`, defined over a probability space `(Ω, P)`.

The Applebaum (2009) Definition 2.3.1 properties are: (a) `N(·, A)` is
Poisson-distributed (captured by `poisson_law`); (b) disjoint-family values
are independent (captured by `independent_disjoint`); (c) `N(ω, ·)` is an
integer-valued atomic measure.

Of (c) the fields below record only the following. For each fixed region of
finite intensity, `integer_valued` gives an almost surely integer value, with an
exceptional null set that depends on that region; there is therefore no single
null set outside which `N ω` is integer-valued on every region at once.
Atomicity is not a field. The simultaneous integer-valued statement on a window
of finite intensity is `Poisson.ae_isIntegerValued_restrict`, and the matching
atomicity — a finite sum of Dirac masses — is `Poisson.ae_exists_eq_sum_dirac`,
both in `Poisson/Atomic.lean` and both under additional countable-generation
hypotheses on the mark space. -/

  finite intensity, `N(·, B)` is a.s. `ℕ`-valued (in the natural embedding
  `ℕ ↪ ℝ≥0∞`). Follows from `poisson_law` since the Poisson distribution
  is supported on `ℕ`. Exposed as a structural field so downstream code
  can use it without re-deriving through the Poisson-law characterisation. -/

  INFINITE intensity, `N(·, B) = ∞` almost surely. This completes the Applebaum
  2.3.1(c) encoding — `integer_valued` covers only the finite-intensity branch.
  Under the literature Poisson recipe construction,
  this is automatic: an infinite-intensity set decomposes into countably
  many finite-intensity pieces, each contributing Poisson(λ_n) atoms, with
  total count = ∑_n Poisson(λ_n) which is a.s. infinite when ∑_n λ_n = ∞. -/

  /-- For any pairwise-disjoint countable family of measurable subsets of

  independent under `P`.

  The `[Countable ι]` hypothesis matches the literature: standard PRM
  independence (Kallenberg 3.5.1 / Applebaum 2.3.1(b)) is for COUNTABLE
  pairwise-disjoint families. Allowing uncountable `ι` would invoke
  Mathlib's `iIndepFun` at uncountable index types, a more delicate notion
  that does not match Applebaum's formulation. -/

  /-- **σ-algebra-level past/future independence.** The σ-algebra generated by
  `{N(·, B) : B ⊆ (−∞, s] × E, B measurable}` (the "past at time `s`") is
  independent of `σ(N(·, (s, t] × A))` (a future increment).

  This is strictly stronger than `independent_disjoint` (which is iIndepFun
  for finite/countable families) and is needed to apply
  `MeasureTheory.condExp_indep_eq` in the compensated stochastic-integral
  proofs. For PRMs it follows from joint independence on disjoint subsets;
  packaged as a structural hypothesis in the same spirit as
  `BrownianMotion.joint_increment_independent`. -/
